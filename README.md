# All of the Things

This is a moderately glorified CRUD app (what isn't?) with three basic purposes:

1. Organize my life.  Like everyone else, I need a life manager.  Like everyone else, all the other ones out there aren't quite what I'm looking for.
2. Get more familiar with DevOps on Heroku.
3. Earn more green squares.
